FHB ServiceNow Integration

FIS has SNOW - they manage all their tickets via SNOW
SNOW is the director and we would implement the remediation actions in Tower to fix problems in our AWS environment

Issue is raised to SNOW - the decision on how to handle it (auto, manual) is determined, then we would build the automation solutions in Tower

Three general categories
	infra mgmt - patching RHEL / OCP
		FIS sees this as two buckets
			Infra commission/decomm
			Security overhaul
	CI/CD dev efforts - app promotion
	app / infra remediation
