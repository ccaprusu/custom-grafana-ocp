- Please spend some time playing with Service Now sandbox, there is an email from Stephen with more info: "FW: MyServices: Big Go Live and Other Updates"
  - Created a [test indicent](https://boehringereval.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=incident.do?sys_id=e5208775dbedcc98da228e24059619a1) in [SNOW](https://boehringereval.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fhome.do) clone of BISM #10433690 But can not assign it to me because I am not part of BI-ITINF-CONTAINER-SERVICES in SNOW, check if you can assign it to you, looks like we are not part of that group. I've been checking but don't know how to request be member of the group etc.

- Evicted prometheus pods are due to ephemeral storage usage issue. The prometheus pod does not use any persistent volumes, once /var/lib/dicker in the node running the pod gets over 85% it estarts evicting the pod and shchedules it in another node.

  - KubeletTooManyPods

 #### [Notes]
- I discussed this too many pods topics with Keerthi and Louis. According to Keerhti is is due to having memory overcommittment and should be relatively fixed once we dimension memory resources more accurately. In the meantime we are going to live with it and not worry about it.
- I spent some time with Sascha Sadat fixing his issue.

- Handover document page 22, We should have access to inventory file also via Bastion server but we have no privileges (/root/openshift/ocp: Permission denied)
  -  I do have access to the directory and the inventory files have a .host extension: 
```
[root@inhas65099 inh-ocprod]# pwd
/root/openshift/ocp/inh-ocprod
[root@inhas65099 inh-ocprod]# ls
certs  docker  grafana_lib_pv.conf  grafana_log_pv.conf  inh-ocprod.hosts  ocoper  tmp  trident-installer
```
